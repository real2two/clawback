## Documentation

This is still a bare-bones prototype, so expect breaking changes!

Also, the source code is a mess. It's terrible. Please don't read my code.

There is the concept of "entities" and "handlers".

- An entity is the command or component data.
- A handler is where you'd run your interaction execution code.

You can check out examples in the `/example` directory.

There aren't proper documentations for this library as of now.
